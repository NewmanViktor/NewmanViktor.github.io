# Professional Portfolio
A completely custom self-developed website created to showcase the engineering portfolio I've acquired throughout my career. Welcome. 
## Background
Employers need to see the proof in the pudding üçÆ. See what I've done and how I've done it. I'll have both short descriptions and in-depth details for each piece of work I've contributed to. Might as well put the HTML, CSS, and JS skills to use.
