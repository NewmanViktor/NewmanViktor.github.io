            <b style="font-size:50px;">Overview</b><br><br>Throughout previous professional work experiences, competitive technical teams, 
            and personal projects, I have developed extensive exposure to a plethora of useful industry standard tools. 
            I'm comfortable programming in C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, and SQL, along with web development languages and various libraries, frameworks, and data structures. 
            I've done a lot of CAD using Altium Designer for PCB design, as well as SolidWorks and AutoCAD for modelling and drafting.

            <b style="font-size:50px;">Analog Design Intern @ AMD</b><br><br>
             My 14-month internship at AMD completely steered my career into a new direction. I worked in the IP Characterization Team that characterizes the different internal and external analog IP that are used in new products.
             I mainly worked with the PCIe sub-team to test and improve AMD's PCIe 5.0 PHY. During my time there, I grew very familiar with various high bandwidth test equipment. Keysight UXRs, BERTs, VNAs, etc. are some of the 
             bleeding-edge test equipment we had in the ESD controlled lab. I spent majority of my time either scripting test automation code which could be used to run mass testing for different conditions and settings, or debugging 
             problems encountered with new PHYs behaving unexpectedly. I loved this role since every day was different. I acquired a completely new understanding of signal integrity and real-world transmission line theory for high-speed 
             communication systems.

            <b style="font-size:50px;">Electrical Engineering Intern @ AC Tesla</b><br><br>
            I've been able to learn quickly from a highly skilled team in conducting efficient and reliable studies and tests in order to maintain High and Medium voltage equipment for
            power distribution systems. I've assisted in conducting a variety of tests such as TTR, DC Hi-Pot, Insulation Testing, Contact Resistance, etc. During my time working both within the office
            and on the field, I've been able to get broad exposure to the power distribution industry. I was given the role of the company's primary CAD Operator, drafting Single Line Diagrams / Routing Plans,
            as well as 3D modelling for part implementation. Throughout my 4-month placement, I drafted 130+ SLD's for various customers including the City of Hamilton, TD, RBC, etc.
